## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Change to support PHP 8.0, 8.1, and 8.2 (PR #1333)

## [8.4.1] - released 2023-03-22
### Fixed
- Fix deprecation notices for PHP 8.x (PR #1329)

## [8.4.0] - released 2023-02-15
### Added
- You can now set a leeway for time drift between servers when validating a JWT (PR #1304)

### Security
- Access token requests that contain a code_verifier but are not bound to a code_challenge will be rejected to prevent
a PKCE downgrade attack (PR #1326)

## [8.3.6] - released 2022-11-14
### Fixed
- Use LooseValidAt instead of StrictValidAt so that users aren't forced to use claims such as NBF in their JWT tokens (PR #1312)

## [8.3.5] - released 2022-05-12
### Fixed
- Use InMemory::plainText('empty', 'empty') instead of InMemory::plainText('') to avoid [new empty string exception](https://github.com/lcobucci/jwt/pull/833) thrown by lcobucci/jwt (PR #1282)

## [8.3.4] - released 2022-04-07
### Fixed
- Server previously rejected valid uris with custom schemes. Now use league/uri for parsing to accept all valid uris (PR #1274)

## [8.3.3] - released 2021-10-11
### Security
- Removed the use of `LocalFileReference()` in lcobucci/jwt. Function deprecated as per [GHSA-7322-jrq4-x5hf](https://github.com/lcobucci/jwt/security/advisories/GHSA-7322-jrq4-x5hf) (PR #1249)

## [8.3.2] - released 2021-07-27
### Changed
- Conditionally support the `StrictValidAt()` method in lcobucci/jwt so we can use version 4.1.x or greater of the library (PR #1236)
- When providing invalid credentials, the library now responds with the error message _The user credentials were incorrect_ (PR #1230)
- Keys are always stored in memory now and are not written to a file in the /tmp directory (PR #1180)
- The regex for matching the bearer token has been simplified (PR #1238)

## [8.3.1] - released 2021-06-04
### Fixed
- Revert check on clientID. We will no longer require this to be a string (PR #1233)

## [8.3.0] - released 2021-06-03
### Added
- The server will now validate redirect uris according to rfc8252 (PR #1203)
- Events emitted now include the refresh token and access token payloads (PR #1211)
- Use the `revokeRefreshTokens()` function to decide whether refresh tokens are revoked or not upon use (PR #1189)

### Changed
- Keys are now validated using `openssl_pkey_get_private()` and `openssl_pkey_get_public()` instead of regex matching (PR #1215)

### Fixed
- The server will now only recognise and handle an authorization header if the value of the header is non-empty. This is to circumvent issues where some common frameworks set this header even if no value is present (PR #1170)
- Added type validation for redirect uri, client ID, client secret, scopes, auth code, state, username, and password inputs (PR #1210)
- Allow scope "0" to be used. Previously this was removed from a request because it failed an `empty()` check (PR #1181)

## [8.2.4] - released 2020-12-10
### Fixed
- Reverted the enforcement of at least one redirect_uri for a client. This change has instead been moved to version 9 (PR #1169)

## [8.2.3] - released 2020-12-02
### Added
- Re-added support for PHP 7.2 (PR #1165, #1167)

### Fixed
- Fix issue where the private key passphrase isn't correctly passed to JWT library (PR #1164)

## [8.2.1] - released 2020-11-26
### Fixed
- If you have a password on your private key, it is now passed correctly to the JWT configuration object. (PR #1159)

## [8.2.0] - released 2020-11-25
### Added
- Add a `getRedirectUri` function to the `OAuthServerException` class (PR #1123)
- Support for PHP 8.0 (PR #1146)

### Removed
- Removed support for PHP 7.2 (PR #1146)

### Fixed
- Fix typo in parameter hint. `code_challenged` changed to `code_challenge`. Thrown by Auth Code Grant when the code challenge does not match the regex. (PR #1130) 
- Undefined offset was returned when no client redirect URI was set. Now throw an invalidClient exception if no redirect URI is set against a client (PR #1140)

## [8.1.1] - released 2020-07-01

### Fixed
- If you provide a valid redirect_uri with the auth code grant and an invalid scope, the server will use the given 
redirect_uri instead of the default client redirect uri (PR #1126)


## [8.1.0] - released 2020-04-29

### Added
- Added support for PHP 7.4 (PR #1075)

### Changed
- If an error is encountered when running `preg_match()` to validate an RSA key, the server will now throw a RuntimeException (PR #1047)
- Replaced deprecated methods with recommended ones when using `Lcobucci\JWT\Builder` to build a JWT token. (PR #1060)
- When storing a key, we no longer touch the file before writing it as this is an unnecessary step (PR #1064)
- Prefix native PHP functions in namespaces with backslashes for micro-optimisations (PR #1071)

### Removed
- Support for PHP 7.1 (PR #1075)

### Fixed
- Clients are now explicitly prevented from using the Client Credentials grant unless they are confidential to conform
 with the OAuth2 spec (PR #1035)
- Abstract method `getIdentifier()` added to AccessTokenTrait. The trait cannot be used without the `getIdentifier()` 
method being defined (PR #1051)
- An exception is now thrown if a refresh token is accidentally sent in place of an authorization code when using the 
Auth Code Grant (PR #1057)
- Can now send access token request without being forced to specify a redirect URI (PR #1096)
- In the BearerTokenValidator, if an implementation is using PDO, there is a possibility that a RuntimeException will be thrown when checking if an access token is revoked. This scenario no longer incorrectly issues an exception with a hint mentioning an issue with JSON decoding. (PR #1107)

## [8.0.0] - released 2019-07-13

### Added
- Flag, `requireCodeChallengeForPublicClients`, used to reject public clients that do not provide a code challenge for the Auth Code Grant; use AuthCodeGrant::disableRequireCodeCallengeForPublicClients() to turn off this requirement (PR #938)
- Public clients can now use the Auth Code Grant (PR #938)
- `isConfidential` getter added to `ClientEntity` to identify type of client (PR #938)
- Function `validateClient()` added to validate clients which was previously performed by the `getClientEntity()` function (PR #938)
- Add a new function to the AbstractGrant class called `getClientEntityOrFail()`. This is a wrapper around the `getClientEntity()` function that ensures we emit and throw an exception if the repo doesn't return a client entity. (PR #1010)

### Changed
- Replace `convertToJWT()` interface with a more generic `__toString()` to improve extensibility; AccessTokenEntityInterface now requires `setPrivateKey(CryptKey $privateKey)` so `__toString()` has everything it needs to work (PR #874)
- The `invalidClient()` function accepts a PSR-7 compliant `$serverRequest` argument to avoid accessing the `$_SERVER` global variable and improve testing (PR #899)
- `issueAccessToken()` in the Abstract Grant no longer sets access token client, user ID or scopes. These values should already have been set when calling `getNewToken()` (PR #919)
- No longer need to enable PKCE with `enableCodeExchangeProof` flag. Any client sending a code challenge will initiate PKCE checks. (PR #938)
- Function `getClientEntity()` no longer performs client validation (PR #938)
- Password Grant now returns an invalid_grant error instead of invalid_credentials if a user cannot be validated (PR #967)
- Use `DateTimeImmutable()` instead of `DateTime()`, `time()` instead of `(new DateTime())->getTimeStamp()`, and `DateTime::getTimeStamp()` instead of `DateTime::format('U')` (PR #963)

### Removed
- `enableCodeExchangeProof` flag (PR #938)
- Support for PHP 7.0 (PR #1014)
- Remove JTI claim from JWT header (PR #1031)

## [7.4.0] - released 2019-05-05

### Changed
- RefreshTokenRepository can now return null, allowing refresh tokens to be optional. (PR #649)

## [7.3.3] - released 2019-03-29

### Added
- Added `error_description` to the error payload to improve standards compliance. The contents of this are copied from the existing `message` value. (PR #1006)

### Deprecated
- Error payload will not issue `message` value in the next major release (PR #1006)

## [7.3.2] - released 2018-11-21

### Fixed
- Revert setting keys on response type to be inside `getResponseType()` function instead of AuthorizationServer constructor (PR #969)

## [7.3.1] - released 2018-11-15

### Fixed
- Fix issue with previous release where interface had changed for the AuthorizationServer. Reverted to the previous interface while maintaining functionality changes (PR #970)

## [7.3.0] - released 2018-11-13

### Changed
- Moved  the `finalizeScopes()` call from `validateAuthorizationRequest` method to the `completeAuthorizationRequest` method so it is called just before the access token is issued (PR #923)

### Added
- Added a ScopeTrait to provide an implementation for jsonSerialize (PR #952)
- Ability to nest exceptions (PR #965)

### Fixed
- Fix issue where AuthorizationServer is not stateless as ResponseType could store state of a previous request (PR #960)

## [7.2.0] - released 2018-06-23

### Changed
- Added new`validateRedirectUri` method AbstractGrant to remove three instances of code duplication (PR #912)
- Allow 640 as a crypt key file permission (PR #917)

### Added
- Function `hasRedirect()` added to `OAuthServerException` (PR #703)

### Fixed
- Catch and handle `BadMethodCallException` from the `verify()` method of the JWT token in the `validateAuthorization` method (PR #904)

## [4.1.7] - released 2018-06-23

### Fixed
- Ensure `empty()` function call only contains variable to be compatible with PHP 5.4 (PR #918)

## [7.1.1] - released 2018-05-21

### Fixed
- No longer set a WWW-Authenticate header for invalid clients if the client did not send an Authorization header in the original request (PR #902)

## [7.1.0] - released 2018-04-22

### Changed
- Changed hint for unsupportedGrantType exception so it no longer references the grant type parameter which isn't always expected (PR #893)
- Upgrade PHPStan checks to level 7 (PR #856)

### Added
- Added event emitters for issued access and refresh tokens (PR #860)
- Can now use Defuse\Crypto\Key for encryption/decryption of keys which is faster than the Cryto class (PR #812)

- Allow specification of query delimiter character in the Password Grant (PR #801)
- Add Zend Diactoros library dependency to examples (PR #678)
- Can set default scope for the authorization endpoint. If no scope is passed during an authorization request, the default scope will be used if set. If not, the server will issue an invalid scope exception (PR #811)
- Added validation for redirect URIs on the authorization end point to ensure exactly one redirection URI has been passed (PR #573)

## [6.0.2] - 2017-08-03

- An invalid refresh token that can't be decrypted now returns a HTTP 401 error instead of HTTP 400 (Issue #759)

## [6.0.1] - 2017-07-19

To address feedback from the security release the following change has been made:

- If an RSA key cannot be chmod'ed to 600 then it will now throw a E_USER_NOTICE instead of an exception.

## [6.0.0] - 2017-07-01

- Breaking change: The `AuthorizationServer` constructor now expects an encryption key string instead of a public key
- Remove support for HHVM
- Remove support for PHP 5.5

## [5.1.4] - 2017-07-01

- Fixed multiple security vulnerabilities as a result of a security audit paid for by the [Mozilla Secure Open Source Fund](https://wiki.mozilla.org/MOSS/Secure_Open_Source). All users of this library are encouraged to update as soon as possible to this version or version 6.0 or greater.
	- It is recommended on each `AuthorizationServer` instance you set the `setEncryptionKey()`. This will result in stronger encryption being used. If this method is not set messages will be sent to the defined error handling routines (using `error_log`). Please see the examples and documentation for examples.

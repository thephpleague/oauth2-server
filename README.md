`league/oauth2-server` is a standards compliant implementation of an [OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) authorization server written in PHP which makes working with OAuth 2.0 trivial. You can easily configure an OAuth 2.0 server to protect your API with access tokens, or allow clients to request new access tokens and refresh them.

Out of the box it supports the following grants:

* Authorization code grant
* Implicit grant
* Client credentials grant
* Resource owner password credentials grant
* Refresh grant

The following RFCs are implemented:

* [RFC6749 "OAuth 2.0"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749)
* [RFC6750 " The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: Bearer Token Usage"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750)
* [RFC7519 "JSON Web Token (JWT)"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)
* [RFC7636 "Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636)

This library was created by Alex Bilbie. Find him on Twitter at [@alexbilbie](https://twitter.com/alexbilbie).

## Requirements

The latest version of this package supports the following versions of PHP:

* PHP 7.2
* PHP 7.3
* PHP 7.4
* PHP 8.0

The `openssl` and `json` extensions are also required.

All HTTP messages passed to the server should be [PSR-7 compliant](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/). This ensures interoperability with other packages and frameworks.

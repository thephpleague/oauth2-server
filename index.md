This library makes working with OAuth 2.0 trivial. You can easily configure an OAuth 2.0 server to protect your API with access tokens, or allow clients to request new access tokens and refresh them.

It supports out of the box the following grants:

* Authorization code grant
* Client credentials grant
* Resource owner password credentials grant
* Refresh grant

You can also define your own grants.

In addition it supports the following token types:

* Bearer tokens
* MAC tokens (coming soon)
* JSON web tokens (coming soon)
